-> Introduction to ML problem
Identifying galaxy mergers. 
This project is a classical example of machine learning applications to astronomy.. 
the goal is to identify in which one of the images we have galaxies which are interacting between each other and in which image we have isolated galaxies.

the website has the code, the paper and the data. 
So you can have a look and understand if the problem seems interesting to you. 


-> Active Learning for SN classification
This is the one I am personally interested. And it is very related to the ideas of the brokers we discussed in our last group meeting. 

https://cosmostatistics-initiative.org/news/portfolio-item/active-learning-for-sn-classification/

I made an implementation in a small data set. 
But this needs to be upgraded. The initial data set had 20.000 objects. 
We will soon have one that has 3 million objects. 
And the idea would be to improve the pipeline described in the link above to LSST. 

This is closely related to the brokers idea. To be honest I do not understand the brokers  myself, but we can try to learn it together if you wish to... 
I am sending attached the document that has been circulating in LSST - of which I understand very little. 

And also there is this recent paper on brokers https://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.07323.pdf
